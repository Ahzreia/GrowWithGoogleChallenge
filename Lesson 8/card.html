			<p>Few Amur Lepoards live in the wild in the Russian Province of Primosky Krai. Amur Leopards differ from other leopards because they are the only leopard subspecies adapted to a cold snowy climate. They have a thick coat of spot-covered fur, long limbs, and are well adapted to walkin through deep snow.</p>
